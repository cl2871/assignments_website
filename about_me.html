				<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>

Through my Money and Banking course, I cultivated an interest in the financial market and became fascinated with the movements of financial capital and the fundamentals behind them. I will not only provide a cooperative, professional attitude to develop meaningful relationships with both clientele and coworkers, but I will also perform at my best to meet company targets. I would love to deepen my understanding of current financial practices and investment strategies, and I am eager to commit myself to the financial service industry.

			<h2>Interests</h2>
			<p>
				During my free time, I watch videos on various topics as well as hang out with my friends. While I used to be an avid gamer, I now prefer to watch gameplay videos by comedic streamers and professional players. Additionally, I enjoy learning about new recipes and watching chefs produce amazing culinary creations. Furthermore, I spend a lot of my time participating in clubs and organizations. Below is a table of leadership positions I have led over the course of my high school and college careers.
