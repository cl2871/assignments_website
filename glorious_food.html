			<h2>Glorious Food</h2>
			<p>
				Hello! Welcome to my "Glorious Food" page, a page dedicated towards glorifying food. As a representative of the human race, I can confidently say that everyone, or at least the vast majority of people, enjoys food. Food is a wonderful substance of varying forms that not only provides us nourishment, but also provides us positive emotions. Through regional availability and the culinary arts, food has influenced and characterized the cultures of all these unqiue nations around the world. Furthermore, through our experiences with eating, we are able to develop relationships with others as well as construct our attitudes towards many aspects of society and our lives.

					Food has always been a major part of my life. As a kid growing up in California, I have always been exposed to the wonderful selection of food within the Bay Area, especially the Asian cuisines that characterize the immigrant communities within the region. One of my dreams as a child was to become a legendary chef that ran a world class restaurant such as "The French Laundry," although my own culinary skills are mediocre at best. Nevertheless, food and the culinary arts have always been a fascinating subject to explore, and, as a result, I became addicted to the Food Network and cooking channels on Youtube. A channel I highly recommend would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqf_rFCGLODeUcw3p_Abr-A"><strong>TasteMade</strong></a>, which showcases various aspects of food. Above is a video from their series "Coastal," featuring Byron Talbott.

			<h2>Favorite Foods</h2>

					Some of my favorite foods include pasta bolognese, Japanese curry, smoked salmon, Korean BBQ beef short ribs, Louisiana crab cakes, and BBQ pork buns. While I enjoy a variety of different kinds of food, a simple dish I have always enjoyed throughout my childhood is tomato and egg rice. While the two main variants are savory and sweet, both of which are delicious, my favorite is the sweet kind, the variant that uses ketchup. Below is a simple recipe for this dish.
