						Article 1: Data Protection in Europe and US
					</h2>
					<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/29/technology/data-privacy-policy-us-europe.html">How Europe Protects Your Online Data Differently Than the US</a></p>
					<p>As the world becomes more and more globalized, the usage of data has become more and more prominent. Currently, we live in an era where data and data analytics does have a significant impact on our lives. Companies such as Google and Nielsen use data on people to drive marketing decisions as well as generate consumer insights. With social networks growing larger every day and businesses such as Amazon having access to large customer bases, significant pools of data are continuously being explored from the databases behind these websites that store user actions. Of course, as a result, concerns such as data privacy and protection are becoming much more significant and relevant.</p>
					<p>Within this article, the New York Times expresses the different ways that Europe and the United States protect the personal data of their citizens. Differences such as the US having the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act yet having no laws against media sources publishing information about individuals via First Amendment and Europe having companies provide customer information upon request suggests that big data can have quite an impact on the policies of various nations. After all, with issues of privacy and protection extending deeper into the digital realm, more and more policies would need to be amended for the modern era. As time goes on, data will become more entrenched into our daily lives, and these issues will only become much more relevant as our actions continue to be monitored within the digital landscape.</p>
					<p>I believe that privacy and protection are issues that will always be relevant to citizens of Western societies, and understanding what rights we have within the digital realm are necessary for us to make meaningful progress. Additionally, rights such as those of the First Amendment and privacy rights can come into conflict, and these complications can be significant topics of debate within the future.</p>

						Article 2: Voter Information Leaked
					</h2>
					<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/us/politics/voting-records-released-privacy-concerns.html">Millions of Voter Records Posted, and Some Fear Hacker Field Day</a></p>
					<p>Very recently, data on millions of voters was released to the internet that revealed the names, addresses, political affiliations, and demographics of those in the database. By being conveniently localized in one area, the leak posed as both a massive security threat as well as a very appealing source of valuable information. Considering that that information could be used for cyber attacks as well as insights for presidential candidates, this leak demonstrated the sheer magnitude that big data could have as well as the consequences of not taking care of such data properly.</p>
					<p>Because the potential for terrible events is there, security is a crucial aspect of data, especially proprietary data, that would need to be considered. With the rise of big data within the modern world, more security measures would need to be implemented to ensure that big data is more beneficial to society than detrimental. Unfortunately, the prevalence of big data will allow for more opportunities for databases to be exploited, which can have devastating effects on certain populations. As it becomes easier to collect and store a variety data, we run the risk of exposing people even more to criminals that wish to use such information for personal gains. While it may be impossible to prevent tragedies from occurring, I believe that dedicating resources towards ensuring that databases are secure will prove to be more valuable than not taking serious efforts.</p>
					<p>In terms of voter information, all aspects of retrieving and storing voter information need to be taken into consideration. From the voting booths all the way to the computer infrastructures that store such personal information, every step needs to be monitored to prevent such a leak from occurring again.</p>
